Github has an post-commit hooks for both IRC and HTTP, so why on earth would I 
write another one?

# Github's hooks cannot be filtered by branch. e.g., if I only want pushes to 
  ``master`` to trigger builds in CI, I'm SOL there. (Jenkins/Hudson doesn't do 
  this either: any branch will trigger the build, even if the branch built 
  didn't change.)

# Jenkins really wants you to make GET requests to trigger builds, and Github 
  (correctly) wants to make POSTs.

So **jig** is my little tool to run an HTTP server, accept Github's 
post-receive data, *filter by branch*, push the relevant info to IRC, then 
trigger a build in Jenkins.

In the spirit of open-source, and because other people may find it useful, I'm 
sharing jig here. I'd like to expand on what sort of project reporting it does 
in the future, too.
